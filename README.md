Prerequisites
=====

The code has been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.
Libraries used:
* numpy
* matplotlib (if you want to run the examples provided)

Short explanation
=====
**Coming soon.** In the mean time [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_multiple_shooting_method) will be sufficient.


Example
=====
Consider the simple problem ![](./doc/bvp_poly.svg) which has the solution 
![](./doc/sol_poly.svg)

By simple substitution we can transform this problem to the form 


![](./doc/transformed_poly.svg)


Now we can turn this into code

```python

```
Ideas for improvement
=====
* Parallelization of the calculation of the jacobian matrix <math> âˆ‡F(s(k)) </math>
* Rewriting the code in Cython
* Using the integrators provided by scipy
* Improving the Newton-methods
